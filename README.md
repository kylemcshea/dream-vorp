## 🌐 Server SetUp

* 🚧 Customize VORP Core to meet your server's needs.
* 🍔 To consume items, go to `vorp_metabolims` and set the items you need.
  * ⚠️ Only items that exist in the database table called `items` will work on your server.
* 📁 Each script has its own config file, job, group, and items. There is no list of jobs or groups.
* 👑 Set yourself as admin in the database table called `users` or in `characters`, depending on your `vorp_core config`.
* ⌨️ The admin menu key is `pagedown`.

## 🎁 Public Plugins
